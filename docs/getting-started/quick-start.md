# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to MailPrism! This guide will have you automating your inbox in under 5 minutes.

## What You'll Need

- A Gmail account (personal or Google Workspace)
- A few minutes to set up your first automation rule

## Step 1: Sign Up

1. Go to [app.mailprism.ai](https://app.mailprism.ai)
2. Click **Get Started** or **Sign Up**
3. Create your account using your email address

## Step 2: Connect Your Gmail

After signing up, you'll be prompted to connect your Gmail account:

1. Click **Connect Gmail**
2. Select the Google account you want to automate
3. Review the permissions MailPrism needs (we explain each one!)
4. Click **Allow** to grant access

:::tip Why these permissions?
MailPrism needs permission to read and modify your emails so it can apply your automation rules. We never share your data with third parties. [Learn more about permissions →](/getting-started/connecting-gmail#permissions-explained)
:::

## Step 3: Create Your First Rule

Once connected, you'll land on your dashboard. Let's create a simple rule:

1. Click **Create Rule** in the top right
2. Give your rule a name, like "Archive Newsletters"
3. Set a condition: **From** contains "newsletter"
4. Set an action: **Archive** the email
5. Click **Save & Enable**

That's it! MailPrism will now automatically archive any email from addresses containing "newsletter".

## Step 4: Watch It Work

| Tier | Check Frequency |
|------|-----------------|
| Free | Every 15 minutes |
